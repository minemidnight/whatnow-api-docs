# OAuth2
OAuth2 enables third-party application developers to build applications that utilize authentication and data from WhatNow's API. There is one type of OAuth2 authentication in WhatNow's API which allows an application to access certain details about a user, depending on the scope, such as their email and username.

# Applications
Developers creating appliations using OAuth2 must use an application, accessible via the Developers section on the website, which will give you the client ID and secret necessary to use OAuth2. If you are implementing OAuth2 from scratch, please see [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) for details on how to use the OAuth2 framework.
